## Gnuplot v6.0.3 for visualizing TEQC +qc results on Windows

I made this one so I can view TEQC qc results as PNG files on Windows. As of Dec 03, 2025, I have only made the script to visualize slip data. I might add sky plots later. I might add one or two lines to convert Hatanaka .yyd data to .yyo for CORS data in the compress RINEX2. Lots of might, and RINEX2 is on the way out!

Here are examples of GODE 2025:321 generated by teqcgnuplot.cmd:

| <img src="images/gode3210.25o/gode3210.25o.slip_i12.png" alt="i12 slips" width=25%> | |

Boring slip plots? Well, this is the case of being a good CORS. GODE has been providing good quality GNSS data since Apr 09, 1997.

## Usage

```sh
teqcgnuplot.cmd <ssss> <yyyy> <ddd>
```

### where:

- `ssss` : the 4-char ID of an NCN station, must be lower-case, e.g. gode
- `yyyy` : year, must be 4 digits, e.g. 2025
- `ddd` : day of year, must be 3 digits, e.g. 328 or 001

## Description

In Windows Command Prompt, teqcgnuplot.cmd will:

- create a folder `ssss\` if not exists; in this folder,
- attempt to download the daily RINEX 2 of the given `ssss` station;
- attempt to download the broadcast ephemeris files of the given `yyyy`:`ddd`
- run TEQC qc with 5 deg elevation cut-off to create a TEQC summary file, a .meta file, and multiple slip plots in PNG format.

## Installation

Download and extract `dist\teqcgnuplot.zip`. I added TEQC Windows 64-bit 7/8/10 (gcc-mingw64 compile, source: https://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/teqc.html) and RNXCMP v4.2.0 Windows (mingw64 compile, source: https://terras.gsi.go.jp/ja/crx2rnx.html) to Gnuplot v6.0.3 Windows (mingw64 compile, source: http://gnuplot.info/ ). You can use TEQC and RNXCMP in Windows from `..\teqcgnuplot\bin\`.

## Example

1. After downloading and extracting `dist/teqcgnuplot.zip`, you will get a subfolder `teqcgnuplot\` and the main `teqcgnuplot.cmd` script.

2. A demo with NEGI 2025:001. The script created a `negi` folder, and downloaded GNSS data of NEGI 2025:001 from NGS servers.

3. The `teqcgnuplot.cmd` ran TEQC +qc at 5deg elevation cut-off to get QC results, then generated various slip plots from the QC results.

4. Process completed! You should get several slip plots in PNG format.
